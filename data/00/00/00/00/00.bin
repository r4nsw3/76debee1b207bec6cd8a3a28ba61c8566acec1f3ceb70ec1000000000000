  |   This time, the terror has followed you home.                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In this last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's original story,   |
  |   you must once again defend yourself against Freddy Fazbear, Chica,    |
  |   Bonnie, Foxy, and even worse things that lurk in the shadows.         |
  |   Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard      |
  |   yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off      |
  |   unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the      |
  |   bed behind you.                                                       |

  |   You have only a flashlight to protect yourself. It will scare away    |
  |   things that may be creeping at the far end of the hallways, but be    |
  |   careful, and listen. If something has crept too close, then shining   |
  |   lights in its eyes will be your end.                                  |
